Energy system optimization with simulatinous minimum spanning tree and node distance solving

Energy policies and market structures differ from country to country. Most often though the distribution and energy side
are handled separately eventhough they are in a tight symbios with each other. In most simple version the grid has fixed energy based pricing for producers and consumer and there is single price for the whole area. In most complex systems the pricing for both changes depending on the location in the grid in node based fashion.

The aim of these energy market structures is to have optimal grid in terms of cost and realiability for the producers and consumers. Previously there has been plenty of studies on how to perform the grid optimization based on various factors in the electrical systems. In these has been noticed that the grid lossess have significant impact of the optimum. The optimizations can get very complex and slow to run.


This paper presents a greedy algorithm inspired by Prims and Dijksras algorithm that used Matrix operations to crete a Minimum Spanning Tree of randomly generated nodes while calculating the distances between each of the network to each other. This way several random netwroked systems can be generated fast with information that can be used for exampe in finding optimal location for productions site and in calculation of grid lossess.

This method was used to compare that should the energy generation and distribution markets bring more closer together by investing a case  where optimal wind farm location was assessed only my using the most optimal locations for generation and also where grid losses where taken into consideration.
